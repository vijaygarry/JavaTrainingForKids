E.g. 
Factor of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 
Factor of 9: 1, 3, 9 (Note: 3 shown only once.)


Himework23:
------------------------
Define a array of 10 numbers. 
Print the mean (Average), Median, Mode, min, max for this array.

Mode
In statistics, the mode is the value in a data set that has the highest number of recurrences. It is possible for a data set to be multimodal, meaning that it has more than one mode. For example:

2,10,21,23,23,38,38
Both 23 and 38 appear twice each, making them both a mode for the data set above.


Median
The statistical concept of the median is a value that divides a data sample, population, or probability distribution into two halves. Finding the median essentially involves finding the value in a data sample that has a physical location between the rest of the numbers. Note that when calculating the median of a finite list of numbers, the order of the data samples is important. Conventionally, the values are listed in ascending order, but there is no real reason that listing the values in descending order would provide different results. In the case where the total number of values in a data sample is odd, the median is simply the number in the middle of the list of all values. When the data sample contains an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two middle values


Range
The range of a data set in statistics is the difference between the largest and the smallest values. While range does have different meanings within different areas of statistics and mathematics.
2,10,21,23,23,38,38
38 - 2 = 36
